# Idle-Village

This project is more a protoype than anything else, but you can still find a build [here](https://github.com/Mystogan98/Idle-Village/raw/master/Idle%20Village.zip)
Remember to play in windowed mode or you'll have to alt+F4 out of the game.

The goal of this game is to build a village out of a plain and some moutains. You start at the stone age with very little people and animations, and finish at a futuristic age with a lot of people and a lot of things going on, so you have a real feeling of evolution.

Clic on the construction sites to build or upgrade a building (shown by a red bubble on top of it as well).

The big 3D rectangles are buildings not yet added to the game.
