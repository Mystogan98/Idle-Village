# Idle-Village

This project is more a protoype than anything else, but you can still find a build [here](https://github.com/Mystogan98/Idle-Village/raw/master/Idle%20Village.zip)

The goal of this game is to build a village out of a plains and some moutains. You start at the stone age with very little people and animations, and finish at a futuristic age with a lot of people and a lot of thing going on, so you have a real feeling of evolution.
The big 3D rectangles are buildings not yet added to the game.
